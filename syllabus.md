# Syllabus

## Coding 1: Data Management and Analysis with R

- Instructor: Kaufmann Marc; Email: KaufmannM@ceu.edu
- Credits: 2 CEU (4 ECTS) 
- Term: Winder 2021-2022
- Course level:  MA/MSc
- Prerequisites: None

## Course description

The course serves as an introduction to the R programming language and software environment for data exploration, data munging, data analysis, and data visualization. 

### Learning outcomes

- Produce meaningful descriptive statistics and informative graphs
- Become familiar with the R ecosystem 
- Learn how to get help, how to debug, how to learn programming
- Learn how to use R for the most common data tasks: loading, cleaning, transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data
- Learn basics of source control with `git`

### Assessment (including minimum pass requirement and grading)

- Participation (15 points): helping yourself and helping others. This will be based on your contribution to the online class forum, as well as your team's team work. This can include getting help from classmates, or searching online forums and email lists. Part of the weekly assignment will be to document your use of any of these resources.
- Weekly assignments (100 points, 15 points per week, 25 points for the final week): You will have weekly assignments consisting primarily of short exercises to get you fluent in R. You will also assess the exercises submitted by your peers, which makes up 5 out of the 15 points per week (10 points out of the 25 for the final week). 

This sums to 115 points, yet your final score will be truncated at 100 (which will count as 100%): if you have a final score of 110, I will treat it as a score of 100 and grade based on that. Thus you have 20 points to lose without it affecting your grade. 

There will be no final exam. 

Minimum passing grade is 51%. Every increase in 7% leads to a higher grade: 51 to 57 yields a C; 58 to 64 yields a C+; 65 to 71 yields a B-; 72 to 78 yields a B; 79 to 85 yields a B+, 86 to 92 yields an A-; 93 to 100 yields an A.

**Assignments:** Since there are weekly assignments, I will not be able to grade them all. Instead, you will grade and provide feedback on each others assignments. I will review a random subset of the submissions and reviewers, making sure to grade everyone at least once (and grading the final assignment of everyone). In general, you will receive full marks on reviewing others, unless it is obvious that you did not care to provide helpful feedback. In that case, you will receive a warning, which means that I will check all your future and past reviews. Any future low-effort review receives 0 points, and any past low-effort review receives 50% of the points at most. I will not discuss reasons for low effort after being caught, nor discuss whether the review was actually low effort. If you cannot do an earnest review in one week, do what you can (which might be nothing) and write me an email *before* the submission deadline. You can use this opportunity once without consequence, the second time you will get more reviews in later weeks.

If you have a question regarding a particular assignment -- whether about the grade or otherwise -- make sure to email me.

Grading the assignments of others serves several purposes:

- There are too many assignments for me to grade
- It is important that there are many assignments, so that you can get practice coding
- By grading other people’s assignments, you will see different ways of solving exercises
- By grading other people’s assignments, you will see how annoying and incomprehensible bad code is that others write (and thus hopefully understand why bad code that you write is equally annoying and incomprehensible)
- Get in the habit of giving and receiving constructive feedback

### Technical/laptop requirement

You will need your laptop with RStudio, R, and git installed in order to participate in class.

### Tentative Course schedule 

**Note:** This is subject to reording and minor changes, but the broad set of topics should remain fairly stable.

1. git; R ecosystem, basic syntax, R Markdown; how to get help; first plot
1. ggplot2: data visualization; introduction to functions
1. Tidyverse: choosing data with `filter()`, `select()`, `arrange()`
1. Tidyverse: transforming data with `mutate()`, `summarise()`, `group_by()`
1. Tidyverse: more transformations with `group_by()`, `mutate()`, and `filter()`
1. Tidyverse: reading data with `read_csv()` and `parse_*()`
1. Tidyverse: tidying data with `spread()` and `gather()`; basic hypotheses testing
1. Tidyverse: `left_join()` and `join()`; basic regressions
1. Functions, loops, and friends; sampling, simulating, bootstrapping (GD)
1. working with data the non-tidyverse way; lubridate for working with dates
1. Basic Spatial Data
1. All the rest

### Short bio of the instructor (1 para)

Marc Kaufmann teaches how to think with economic models, and how to use them to ask the right questions. He studied at Cambridge, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Berkeley, and Harvard. He studies the perceptions and beliefs people hold, how this affects their decisions and specifically their productivity.
